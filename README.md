# util-actions

A set of utility actions for use in GitHub action workflows.

## Usage

Actions in this repo can be used by referencing the folder in which they live and a tag e.g.

```yml
- uses: OctopusDeploy/util-actions/find-and-replace-all@find-and-replace-all.0.1.0
```

Note: At the moment only specific tags are supported, there is no major version available.

## Actions

### `add-changeset`

This action allows you to add a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) to your project to help with automation scenarios, particularly around pre-release package creation and publishing. The action will search your repository to find any packages and add a changeset with the configured SemVer type and summary message to your repo. Note this action does not commit the changeset, it only creates the file for consumption within the rest of your workflow.

For example you might to create a set of pre-release npm packages for each commit to the `main` branch or in a PR and you want these all to have the same version with all the dependencies aligned correctly. Versioning your packages with changesets normally will only bump any packages that are listed in a changeset plus any packages with updated dependencies, you can use this action to automatically add an additional changeset to bump any other packages.

#### Example

_String_

String replacement is case-sensitive.

```yml
- uses: OctopusDeploy/util-actions/find-and-replace-all@find-and-replace-all.0.1.0
  with:
    source: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    searchString: the
    replace: hooray
```

This will result in an output variable named `value` with a value of `The quick brown fox jumps over hooray lazy dog`. The case-sensitivity here is important to note.

_Regular Expression_

```yml
- uses: OctopusDeploy/util-actions/find-and-replace-all@find-and-replace-all.0.1.0
  with:
    source: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog
    searchRegex: the
    searchRegexFlags: i # case-insensitive
    replace: hooray
```

This will result in an output variable named `value` with a value of `hooray quick brown fox jumps over hooray lazy dog`.
